Matlab model for EVM: y1275963.github.io

* Branch Functional_mode:

  For real application, costing more time in coverting image into NTSF format & read in image from souce video.
  
* Branch debug_mode:
  
  * For algorithm design, load data directly from previous data file, and the images are compressed(Gaussian Pryamid) . It is very fast..
  * No video generated, push any key to render next image.
